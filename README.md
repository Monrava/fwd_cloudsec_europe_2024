## Description
This repository contains the presentation that I gave during fwd:cloudsec2024 in Europe.

The topic was GCP and AWS identity federation where we presented our lessons learned from implementing this at Spotify at scale.

We also covered some of the methods that we found can be used for cross-cloud forensics and incident response.

See slides for details.
